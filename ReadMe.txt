HELBLING FILE RENAMER

This is build to automate the copying of Filenames from the Excel-sheet
to the actual files.

Handling:
3 informations are needed for the programm to run:
[] Location of Excel-sheet 
-> including filename of the sheet.xls
-> Be carful, that you mark every audio as "audio" in the sheet.
If something is marked wrong the programm won't work as planned

[] Location of audio-files to be renamed
-> There must be ONLY these files that need to be renamed
-> They must be in the same order as in the Excelsheet

[] Location for new renamed audios
